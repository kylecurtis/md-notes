## 1. The Interview Process

<br>

#### **Interview Basics**

> - You should do your best to talk out loud throughout the problem and explain your thought process.
> <br>
> - Your interviewer might jump in sometimes to help you; let them. It's normal and doesn't really mean that you're doing poorly. (That said, of course not needing hints is even better.)

#### **Interview Assessment**

> Your interviewer will make an assessment of your performance, usually based on the following:
> <br>
> - **Analytical skills:** Did you need much help solving the problem? How optimal was your solution? How long did it take you to arrive at a solution? If you had to design/architect a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?
> <br>
> - **Coding skills:** Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and well organized? Did you think about potential errors? Did you use good style?
> <br>
> - **Technical knowledge / Computer Science fundamentals:** Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?
> <br>
> - **Experience:** Have you made good technical decisions in the past? Have you built interesting, challenging projects? Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?
> <br>
> - **Culture fit / Communication skills:** Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

#### **The Whiteboard**

> - It's absolutely true that you'd struggle with writing perfect code on a whiteboard. Fortunately, your interviewer doesn't expect that. 
> <br>
> - Whiteboards let you focus on what matters. Virtually everyone has some bugs or minor syntactical errors.
> <br>
> - That's not to say that you should just write pseudocode or that correctness doesn't matter. Most interviewers aren't okay with pseudocode, and fewer errors are better.
> <br>
> - Whiteboards also tend to encourage candidates to speak more and explain their thought process.
