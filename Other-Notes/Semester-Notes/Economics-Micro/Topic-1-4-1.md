## Fundamentals of Markets

Firms (i.e. businesses, suppliers, sellers, etc.):
- Supply goods (or services).

Consumers (i.e. buyers):
- Purchase goods supplied by firms.

Exchange Happens:
- Through prices established in markets.
- Supply or demand factors can change the market price.

<br>

*Market*
- Place where buyers and sellers meet.
- Doesn't have to be a physical place.

<br>

<br>

## Competitive Markets

Characteristics of a *competitive* market:

- Many buyers and sellers.
- The goods sold by each vendor are similar.
- No one individual has any influence over the price.

<br>

---

<br>

## Imperfect Markets

*Imperfect Market*:
- Buyer or seller has an influence on the price.

*Market Power*:
- The firm's ability to influence the price.

*Monopoly*:
- A single company that supplies the entire market for a good or service.

<br>

<br>

## Demand

- The amount of some good or service consumers are *willing* and *able* to purchase at each price.
- In other words, Demand is a relationship between price and Qd.

<br>

#### Price:

- What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service.

<br>

#### Quantity demanded ($Q_{d}$)

- The total number of units of a good or service consumers are willing to purchase at a given price.
	- An amount or number.
	- Every price has a corresponding Qd.
	- demand != quantity demanded.

<br>

#### Law of Demand

- Ceteris paribus, there is an inverse (negative) relationship between price and quantity demanded.
- If price goes up, quantity demanded goes down.
- If price goes down, quantity demanded goes up.

<br>

#### Demand Schedule:

- A table that shows a range of prices for a certain good or service and the quantity demanded at each price.

<br>

#### Demand Curve:

- A graphic representation of the relationship between price and quantity demanded of a certain good or service.
	- Quantity on the horizontal x-axis and the price on the vertical y-axis.
- Demand Curves always point down! 

<br>

---

<br>

## Market Demand

#### Market Demand:

- Horizontal sum of all individual quantities demanded by each buyer in the market at each price.

<br>

---

<br>

## Changes in Qd vs Changes in Demand

#### Changes in Quantity Demanded:

- Movement along a demand curve.
- Caused by a change in the *price* of a good.

#### Changes in Demand:

- Shift of the demand curve.
	- Entire demand curve will shift to the left (decrease).
	- Or the right (increase).
- Caused by changes in *nonprice* factors.

<br>

<br>

## Supply

- The amount of some god or service a producer is willing to supply at each price.

#### Quantity Supplied ($Q_{s}$)
- The total number of units of a good or service producers are willing to sell at a given price.
	- An amount or number.
	- Every price has a corresponding Qs.
	- Supply != Quantity Supplied.

<br>

#### Law of Supply

- Ceteris paribus, there is a direct (positive) relationship between price and quantity supplied.
	- If price increases, quantity supplied increases.
	- If price decreases, quantity supplied decreases.

<br>

#### Supply Schedule

- A table that shows a range of prices for a certain good or service and the quantity supplied at each price.

<br>

#### Supply Curve

- A graphic representation of the relationship between price and quantity supplied of a certain good or service.
	- Quantity on the horizontal x-axis and the price on the vertical y-axis.

<br>

---

<br>

## Market Supply

- Horizontal sum of all individual quantities supplied by each seller in the market at each price.

<br>

---

<br>

## Changes in Qs vs Changes in Supply

#### Change in Quantity supplied

- Movement along a supply curve.
- Caused by a change in the *price* of a good.

<br>

#### Change In Supply

- Shift of the supply curve.
	- Entire supply curve will shift to the left (decrease) or right (increase).
- Caused by changes in *nonprice* factors.

<br>

<br>

## Bringing Supply and Demand Together

- Graphs for demand and supply both have price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis.
	- Demand and supply curves can appear on the same coordinate system.

- How is the price of a good determined?
	- Through the market forces of supply and demand!

<br>

#### Equilibrium

- The combination of price and quantity where there is no economic pressure that would cause price or quantity to change:

Quantity demanded = quantity supplied

<br>

#### Law of Supply and Demand

- The market price of any good will adjust to bring the quantity supplied and quantity demanded into balance.

<br>

#### Equilibrium Price

- The price at which quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded.
- The price that "clears the market".

<br>

#### Equilibrium Quantity

- The quantity at which quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied.

<br>

- Demand and supply curves can also be represented with equations:
	- Suppose that quantity demanded (QD) is represented by the following equation: QD = 90 - 3P
	- The quantity supplied (Qs) is represented by this equation: Qs = P + 10
	- With these equations we can *solve for the equilibrium* price and quantity.

<br>

---

<br>

#### Shortage

- Occurs when QD > Qs
- Occurs at any price below equilibrium:
	- Price will rise over time toward equilibrium
	- Recall Law of Supply and Demand

- Why does price rise over time with shortage?
	- Consumers will "outbid" other consumers.

<br>

#### Surplus

- Occurs when Qs > QD
- Occurs at any price above equilibrium:
	- Price will fall over time toward equilibrium.
	- Again, apply the Law of Supply and Demand.

- Why does price fall over time with a surplus?
	- Firms will lower prices to get rid of mounting inventories.
