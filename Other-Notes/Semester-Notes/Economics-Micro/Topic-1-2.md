## Topic 1.2 (Chapter 1 & 2)

<br>

### Key Questions

1. How do economists study the economy?
2. How do resources flow through an economy?
3. How do economists use data and graphs?

<br>

## The Scientific Method in Economics

- Economists use the scientific method to explain a economic phenomena:
	1. Observe a phenomena
	2. Develop a hypothesis
	3. Construct a model to test the theory
	4. Design an experiment to test how well the model works and collects data
	5. Revise or refute the theory based on evidence

## Positive and Normative Analysis

A *positive statement* can be tested and validated.
- Describes "what is".

<br>

A *normative statement* is an opinion that cannot be tested or validated.
- Describes "what ought to be".

<br>

> NOTE: Economists are concerned with positive analysis (positive statements). Avoid opinions (normative).

<br>

### Examples

1. Rich people should be taxed more. - Normative
2. More taxes on the rich will increase tax revenues. - Positive
3. Everyone should donate to charity. - Normative
4. Government intervention in markets is bad. - Normative
5. Economics majors earn more on average than sociology majors do. - Positive

## Economics Models

- Economists use models to understand the complex real-world economy.

*Models* are simplified representations of some sector of the economy that includes enough key features to help us understand it.

- Also called *theories*.
- Use assumptions (help us simplify what is most important and what should be taken out).
- Good models predict accurately.

<br>

- *Endogenous factors* are variables that can be controlled for inside a model.
- *Exogenous factors* are variables that cannot be accounted for in a model.

<br>

*Ceteris paribus*

- Latin for "other things being equal".
- Used to build economic models.
- Allows economists to examine a change in one variable while holding everything else constant.
- For example, studying what cutting sugar from your diet can do without changing any other parts of your diet.

## Models and Ceteris Paribus

Who gets paid more?

- Educated or uneducated individuals?
- Skilled or unskilled labor?
- Worker right out of college or older worker?
- New employee or veteran employee?
- Safe or dangerous job?

## Rational Behavior Assumption

- *Rational behavior*: a decision where marginal benefit >= marginal cost.
- *Irrational behavior*: a decision where marginal benefit <= marginal cost.
- Economists assume people are inherently rational.

<br>

---

<br>

## Objections to the Economic Approach

People, firms, and society *don't* act like this (rationally)

- Not enough information
- People aren't this careful.

People, firms, and society *shouldn't* act like this

- Self-interest.

<br>

<br>

## Circular Flow

- The *circular flow* is a diagram that shows how resources and final goods and services flow through the economy.

Two Groups:
	- Households
	- Firms

Two Markets:
	- Resource market
	- Product market

<br>

Households -> Resource Market -> Firms -> Product Market (repeat)

Money flow: Firms -> $ -> Resource Market -> $ -> Households -> $ -> Product Market -> $ -> Firms

Government: Between Households and firms: Households < - > Government ($) < - > Firms

<br>

- *Barter* is individuals trading a good or service in exchange for something they want.
- The *double coincident of wants* occurs when each party in an exchange transaction has what the other person desires.

<br>

## Graphs with One Variable

There are two ways to show data with one variable:

- Bar graphs
- Pie charts

Graphs with one variable using time:

- *Time Series Graph* illustrates information about 1 variable over time.

<br>

---

<br>

## Graphs with Two Variables

Slope:

- *independent variable*: causes the change
- *dependent variable*: influenced as a result (variable measured)

<br>

- *Scatter plot* shows the x and y variables in a coordinate system.
- *Positive correlation* - The variables move together in the same direction.
- *Negative correlation* - The variables move in the opposite direction (inverse).
- *Zero correlation* - The variables are not related (flat line).
- *Convex relationship* - Arc (+ then -).
- *Concave relationship* - Arc (- then +).

<br>

<br>

## Danger of Faulty Assumptions

When building a model, you must decide:

- Variables to include or exclude.
- Evaluate the relationship between variables.

<br>

Graphs show the relationships between 2 variables:

- *Coincidence* is the weakest connection.
- *Correlation* is stronger than coincidence.
- *Causation* is the strongest form of connection.

<br>

> NOTE: Correlation != Causation - there is missing information

<br>

- *Reverse causation* you flip the casual relationship (flip the relationship of variables).
