## Topic 1.3 (Chapter 2 & 6)

<br>

### Key Questions

1. How do economists measure consumer satisfaction?
2. How do consumers make the best choices?
3. What is the Diamon-Water Paradox?

<br>

## Utility

- *Utility* - satisfaction, usefulness, or value one obtains from consuming goods and services.
- *Utils* - units for measuring utility (happiness points).

> Individuals try to maximize utility.

<br>

---

<br>

## Utility Varies 

Between Individuals:

- For a sandwich: John = 20 utils, Steve = 10 utils.
- Each person has a different utility scale.

Internal Comparisons:

- For John: 20 utils = sandwich, 30 utils = burger.

## Total Vs Marginal Utility

- *Total Utility* - the overall amount of happiness from consumption.
- *Marginal Utility* - the additional utility gained from consuming one more unit of a good or service.

<br>

- *The law of diminishing marginal utility* - as we consume more of a good or service, the utility we get from additional units of the good or service tends to become smaller than what we received from earlier units.

<br>

Table Equation: Change in Total Utility / Change in Quantity

Graph Equation: Add up the Utils leading up to the number of Oreos, etc. consumed.

## Sunk Costs

- Endless shrimp at Red Lobster starts at $15.99.
- Marginal thinking always considers what will happen next, *decisions shouldn't look back*.
- *Sunk Costs* - costs that we make in the past that we cannot recover.

<br>

<br>

## Diminishing Marginal Utility

- Does marginal utility ever increase?
	- Rarely
	- Always temporarily

- The law of diminishing marginal utility does not have to decline immediately, just at some point.

<br>

<br>

## How Do Consumers Make the Best Choices?

- Imagine a world with only 2 goods: Coffee ($2), Bagels ($4).
- You have $20.
- How much of each good will you buy to maximize your utility?

<br>

---

<br>

## Budget Constraint

- *Budget constraint* - all possible consumption combinations of goods that someone can afford, given the prices of goods, when all income is spent; the boundary of the opportunity set.

<br>

---

<br>

## Get the Most Bang for Your Buck

- Choose goods that give you the most utility per dollar spent.

$\frac{MU Coffee}{Price Coffee}$ Which is larger? $\frac{MU bagel}{Price Bagel}$

- This gives us the utility per dollar spent on each item.

<br>

---

<br>

## Consumer Optimum:

- Calculate MU / Per dollar for table
- Compare MU / Per dollar + pick the bigger bang for buck (cross it off).
- Subtract the price from overall budget.
- Stop when all the money is spent and MU / Per dollar is equal.

<br>

---

<br>

## More Than 2 Goods

- Budget constraints aren't realistic.
- People choose between thousands of goods in a modern economy.
- Use multiple budged constraints and extend the previous rule:

MU A / Price A = MU B / Price B = MU C / Price C = ...

## The Diamond Water Paradox

"Nothing is more useful than water, but it will purchase scarcely anything; scarcely anything can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarcely any use-value, but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it" - Adam Smith.

Where's the confusion?

- Compares the marginal utility of a very scarce good (diamond) with the marginal utility of an abundant good (water) after already consuming a large amount.

Water:

- High value use: Drinking, bathing, cooking, etc.
- Low value use: Watering lawns, washing cars, etc.

In other words, Marginal utility matters more for consumption decisions than total utility.
