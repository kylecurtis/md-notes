### What is Economics?

#### *Scarcity* 

means human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available.

- Unlimited wants > limited resources.
- Applies to every resource, person, and economy.

#### *Economics* 

is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity.

- The economic problem.

> NOTE: It's basically a social science about scarcity.

### Resources

4 main categories of resources (factors of production):

- *Land* - naturally occurring resources.
- *Labor* - human effort.
- *Capital* - Physical capital (equipment, tools, machinery), Human capital (knowledge, education, training/skills).
- *Entrepreneurship* - Combining the other resources to create a new product or business.

### Micro vs Macro Economics

#### *Microeconomics* 

focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households, workers, and businesses.

- Individual units that make up an economy.

#### Questions related to microeconomics

- How many movies does a family chose to see every year?
- What variables affect an individual's career choice?
- How would a new sales tax affect retail markets?
- How does health insurance affect people's demand for healthcare?

<br>

#### *Macroeconomics* 

is the branch of economics that focuses on broad issues such as growth, unemployment, inflation, and trade balance.

- The "big picture".

#### Questions related to macroeconomics

- What is the current inflation rate in the US?
- Is the US in a recession right now?
- How does federal debt affect our economy (national debt)?
- Is the Covid recession worse than the one in 2008?

<br>

> NOTE: Macro vs Micro: Does it cross industry? If so, it's macroeconomics.

### Fundamental Concepts in Economics

<br>

#### 1. Incentives matter

- *Incentives* are factors that motivate you to act or exert effort.
- Anything that changes the benefits or cost of a decision.
- A *positive incentive* offers rewards or payments (Sales commission, allowance, etc.).
- A *negative incentive* provides consequence or punishment (Job loss, grounding, etc.).
- A *direct incentive* says "here's what I want you to do, here's how I am going to get you to do it".
	- Easy to recognize.
- An *indirect incentive* is a secondary change in behavior brought on by the original incentive.
	- Difficult to recognize.
	- An *unintended consequence* is an unplanned result of an indirect incentive.

<br>

#### 2. Life is about choices

- Scarcity implies choice, leading to *tradeoffs*:
	- To get one thing, you must give up another thing.
	- *Every decision incurs a cost*.

<br>

#### 3. Consider opportunity costs

- *Opportunity cost* is the highest-valued alternative that must be sacrificed to get something else.
- Not all alternatives-just the next-best choice.

<br>

#### 4. Make decisions at the margin

- *Marginal analysis* is examining the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a good.
- Do an action with marginal benefit >= marginal cost.
- Example: Moving a couch or cabinet while vacuuming your living room:
	- Marginal benefit = small additional amount of carpet cleaned.
	- Marginal cost = much more time and effort.

> NOTE: *Marginal* = additional.

<br>

#### 5. Trade creates value

- *Trade* is the voluntary exchange of goods and services between two or more parties.
- There are no losers.
- *Markets* are places that bring buyers and sellers together to exchange goods and services.
- The most effective way to deal with scarcity.
- Without trade, you would have to produce everything you consume.
- *Division of labor* is the way in which different workers divide required tasks to produce a good or service.

<br>

- *Specialization* occurs when workers or firms focus on tasks for which they are well-suited within the overall production process.
- Specialization allows businesses to take advantage of *economies of scale* - as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines.
- *Comparative advantage* is the situation in which an individual, business, or country can produce at a lower opportunity cost than a competitor. 

<br>

- *Globalization* is the trend in which buying and selling in markets have increasingly crossed national borders.
- *Exports* are the goods and services that a nation produces domestically and sells abroad.
- *Imports* are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically.

## How are economies organized

Three major ways to organize economies:

### 1. Traditional Economies

- A *traditional economy* is typically an agricultural economy where things are done the same as they have always been done.
- Oldest system.

### 2. Market Economies

- A *market economy* is an economy where economic decisions are decentralized, private individuals own resources, and businesses supply goods and services based on demand.
- The *invisible hand* is the positive social outcomes resulting from individual pursuits of self-interest.

### 3. Planned / Command Economies

- A *command economy* is an economy where economic decisions are passed down from government authority and where he government owns the resources.

## The Reality of Modern Economics

- *Mixed economies* combine elements of command and market economies:
	- Regulations are the "rules of the game".
	- No pure market or command economies (i.e. No markets that are completely free from government control, and vise versa).
