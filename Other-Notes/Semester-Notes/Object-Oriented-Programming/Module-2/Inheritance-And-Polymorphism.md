## Inheritance

- Used in Java to create a hierarchy between classes.
- When a class inherits from another class, it is able to acquire all of the behaviors of the parent class.
- Inheritance is transitive: if a cars is a land vehicle and a land vehicle is a vehicle, a car is also a vehicle.

<br>

- A mechanism in Java where one class can inherit the properties and methods of another class.
- We often refer to the inherited class as the "parent" and the class that inherits as the "child".

## Polymorphism

- Allows us to perform an action in various ways.
- This term means "many forms".
- In java, it allows methods to perform different tasks based on the object that calls them.
- This is closely linked with inheritance.

## Key Definitions

- *Method Overriding*: When a child class defines a method that already exists in it's parent class, this is called method overriding. It allows the child class to provide it's specific implementation of a method already defined in it's parent class.
- *Interfaces*: An interface in Java is a reference type that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. They are similar to abstract classes but can only contain method declarations, not implementations.
