In C#, a string is not simply a character array, although it can be thought of as akin to an array of characters for some operations. In essence, a string is an instance of the `System.String` class that provides a range of sophisticated methods and properties, encapsulating a sequence of Unicode characters.

The main differentiation between a string and a character array is that strings in C# are immutable, meaning that once created, they cannot be changed. Any operations that appear to alter the string are actually creating a new string and discarding the old one. This design enhances security and improves performance for static or rarely changing text.

On the other hand, character arrays are mutable, and individual elements can be changed freely. This mutability comes at the cost of not having built-in text manipulation and comparison methods, as strings do.

For instance, we create a string as follows:

```csharp
string welcomeMessage = "Welcome to Academy!";
```

Once you have a string in C#, there are many operations you can perform on it. The `Length` property, for example, returns the number of characters in the string.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(welcomeMessage.Length); // Outputs: 19
```

This tells us that our `welcomeMessage` string is 19 characters long.

String concatenation is another operation that is used frequently. It is performed using the `+` operator.

```csharp
string firstString = "Welcome ";
string secondString = "to Academy!";
string concatenatedString = firstString + secondString;
Console.WriteLine(concatenatedString); // Outputs: "Welcome to Academy!"
```

When it comes to manipulating the casing of strings, the `String` class provides the `ToLower` and `ToUpper` methods. `ToLower` converts all the characters in a string to lowercase, while `ToUpper` converts them all to uppercase.

```csharp
string lowerCaseString = welcomeMessage.ToLower();
Console.WriteLine(lowerCaseString); // Outputs: "welcome to academy!"

string upperCaseString = welcomeMessage.ToUpper();
Console.WriteLine(upperCaseString); // Outputs: "WELCOME TO ACADEMY!"
```

There are also methods to check whether a string starts or ends with a specific substring. These are the `StartsWith` and `EndsWith` methods, respectively.

```csharp
bool startsWithWelcome = welcomeMessage.StartsWith("Welcome");
Console.WriteLine(startsWithWelcome); // Outputs: True

bool endsWithProgramming = welcomeMessage.EndsWith("Academy!");
Console.WriteLine(endsWithProgramming); // Outputs: True
```

A common requirement in programming is to determine whether a specific substring exists within a larger string. This can be accomplished with the `Contains` method.

```csharp
bool containsCsharp = welcomeMessage.Contains("C#");
Console.WriteLine(containsCsharp); // Outputs: False
```

Sometimes, you may need to replace all occurrences of a substring within a string with another substring. The `Replace` method allows you to do this.

```csharp
string replacedMessage = welcomeMessage.Replace("Academy", "HTB Academy");
Console.WriteLine(replacedMessage); // Outputs: "Welcome to HTB Academy!"
```

You can use the `Equals` method or the `==` operator when comparing two strings for equality. Both perform a case-sensitive comparison by default.

```csharp
string str1 = "Welcome";
string str2 = "welcome";
bool areEqual = str1.Equals(str2);
Console.WriteLine(areEqual); // Outputs: False
```

In addition to the basic operations mentioned above, there are several advanced operations that C# offers for string manipulation.

One of these operations is string interpolation, which provides a more readable and convenient syntax to format strings. Instead of using complicated string concatenation to include variable values within strings, string interpolation allows us to insert expressions inside string literals directly. To create an interpolated string in C#, prefix the string with a `$` symbol, and enclose any variables or expressions you want to interpolate in curly braces `{}`. When the string is processed, these expressions are replaced by their evaluated string representations.

```csharp
string name = "Alice";
string greeting = $"Hello, {name}!";
Console.WriteLine(greeting); // Outputs: "Hello, Alice!"
```

In the above example, `{name}` inside the string literal is replaced by the value of the variable `name`.

Another important string operation is trimming, which is performed using the `Trim` method. This is commonly used to remove a string's leading and trailing white space.

```csharp
string paddedString = "    Extra spaces here    ";
string trimmedString = paddedString.Trim();
Console.WriteLine(trimmedString); // Outputs: "Extra spaces here"
```

The `Substring` method extracts a portion of a string starting at a specified index and continuing for a specified length. For instance:

```csharp
string fullString = "Hello, World!";
string partialString = fullString.Substring(7, 5);
Console.WriteLine(partialString); // Outputs: "World"
```

In the above example, `Substring(7, 5)` returns a new string starting at index 7 and of length 5 from the `fullString`.

Moreover, using the `Split` method, strings can be split into arrays of substrings based on delimiters. This is especially useful when parsing input or handling data that comes in string form.

```csharp
string sentence = "This is a sentence.";
string[] words = sentence.Split(' ');
foreach (string word in words)
{
    Console.WriteLine(word);
}
// Outputs: 
// "This"
// "is"
// "a"
// "sentence."
```

In this example, the `Split` method splits the `sentence` string into an array of words based on the space character delimiter.

Lastly, the `Join` method concatenates all elements in a string array or collection, using a specified separator between each element.

```csharp
string[] words = { "This", "is", "a", "sentence" };
string sentence = string.Join(" ", words);
Console.WriteLine(sentence); // Outputs: "This is a sentence"
```

In this case, `Join` constructs a single string from all the elements in the `words` array, with a space character as the separator.
