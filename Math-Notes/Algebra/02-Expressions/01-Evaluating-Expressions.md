Evaluating algebraic expressions involves substituting values for variables and then simplifying the expression according to the order of operations. Special attention is needed when dealing with negative values and properly grouping terms.

## Substituting Values for Variables

When evaluating expressions, each variable is replaced with a given numeric value. This step is crucial before applying any arithmetic operations.

#### Basic Substitution

Consider the expression $2x + 3y - 5$ where $x = 3$ and $y = -2$.

- Substitute the values: $2(3) + 3(-2) - 5$
- Simplify: $6 - 6 - 5 = -5$

#### Handling Double Negatives

When substituting negative numbers, especially into expressions with subtraction or negative coefficients, care must be taken to handle the signs correctly.

- Expression: $-x + 4$ where $x = -3$
- Substitute: $-(-3) + 4$
- Simplify: $3 + 4 = 7$

## Grouping Terms and Order of Operations

Proper grouping and following the PEMDAS rule ensure correct evaluation of expressions, especially when multiple operations are involved.

#### Grouping with Parentheses

Consider evaluating $3(x - 2) + 4$ with $x = 5$.

- Substitute the value of $x$: $3(5 - 2) + 4$
- Simplify inside parentheses: $3(3) + 4$
- Multiply: $9 + 4 = 13$

## Complex Expression

Evaluate the expression $2(a + 3b) - c$ where $a = -1$, $b = 2$, and $c = -3$.

- Substitute values: $2((-1) + 3(2)) - (-3)$
- Simplify inside parentheses: $2(-1 + 6) + 3$
- Continue: $2(5) + 3$
- Multiply and add: $10 + 3 = 13$
