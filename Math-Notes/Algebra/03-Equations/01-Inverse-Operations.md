Inverse operations are mathematical processes that reverse the effect of another operation. They are fundamental in solving equations and manipulating algebraic expressions to isolate variables.

## Types of Inverse Operations

<br>

---

<br>

#### Addition and Subtraction

<br>

- **Addition**: Adding a number to another.
<br>
- **Inverse Operation (Subtraction)**: Subtracting a number reverses the effect of addition.
<br>
- **Example**: If $a + b = c$, then $c - b = a$.

<br>

<br>

#### Multiplication and Division

<br>

- **Multiplication**: Multiplying a number by another.
<br>
- **Inverse Operation (Division)**: Dividing by a number reverses the effect of multiplication.
<br>
- **Example**: If $a \times b = c$, then $c / b = a$.

<br>

<br>

#### Exponents and Roots

<br>

- **Exponents**: Raising a number to the power of another.
<br>
- **Inverse Operation (Roots)**: Taking the root of a number reverses the effect of exponentiation.
<br>
- **Example**: If $a^b = c$, then $\sqrt[b]{c} = a$.

#### Functions and Their Inverses

<br>

- **Function**: A rule that assigns each input exactly one output.
<br>
- **Inverse Function**: A function that undoes the action of the original function, reversing its effect.
<br>
- **Example**: If $f(x) = 2x + 3$, the inverse function, $f^{-1}(x)$, would be $(x - 3)/2$.

## Applying Inverse Operations in Algebra

<br>

---

<br>

#### Solving Equations

Using inverse operations to isolate the variable is a key strategy in algebraic problem-solving.

<br>

---

<br>

#### Example: Linear Equation

Solve for $x$ in the equation $3x + 5 = 20$.

- **Step 1**: Subtract 5 from both sides.  
  
  $3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5$
  
  $3x = 15$
<br>
- **Step 2**: Divide both sides by 3.  
  
  $\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}$
  
  $x = 5$

## Checking Solutions

Inverse operations are also used to verify solutions by reversing the steps.

<br>

---

<br>

#### Example: Verification
Check if $x = 5$ is a solution for $3x + 5 = 20$.
- **Step 1**: Substitute $x = 5$ into the equation.  
  
  $3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20$
<br>
- **Step 2**: Since the original equation holds true, $x = 5$ is the correct solution.
