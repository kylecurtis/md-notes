Balancing equations is a fundamental principle in algebra that ensures the equality of an equation is maintained while solving for variables. This method involves performing identical operations on both sides of the equation.

## Principle of Balance

<br>

- **Rule**: Whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other side.
- **Purpose**: This maintains the equality set by the original equation.

<br>

<br>

#### Step 1: Identify the Operation to Perform

Determine the operation needed to isolate the variable (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

<br>

#### Step 2: Perform the Operation Equally

Apply the chosen operation to both sides of the equation. This keeps the equation balanced and the scales equal.

<br>

#### Step 3: Simplify Both Sides

After performing the operation, simplify each side of the equation as much as possible to clearly see the next steps or to find the solution.

<br>

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution

Substitute the value back into the original equation to check if the balance holds true.

## Example: Solving a Simple Equation

<br>

Solve the equation $2x + 6 = 16$.

<br>

- **Isolate the Variable**: Subtract 6 from both sides to begin isolating $x$.

  $2x + 6 - 6 = 16 - 6$
  
  $2x = 10$

<br>

- **Solve for x**: Divide both sides by 2.
  $\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}$
  
  $x = 5$

<br>

<br>

#### Verification Example

Check $x = 5$ in $2x + 6 = 16$.

$2(5) + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16$

<br>

The equation balances, confirming that $x = 5$ is the correct solution.

## Balancing Specific Operations

<br>

#### Addition
- **Equation**: $x - 7 = 10$
- **Operation**: Add 7 to both sides to isolate $x$.
- **Solution**:

  $x - 7 + 7 = 10 + 7$
  
  $x = 17$

<br>

#### Subtraction
- **Equation**: $x + 5 = 3$
- **Operation**: Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate $x$.
- **Solution**:

  $x + 5 - 5 = 3 - 5$
  
  $x = -2$

<br>

#### Multiplication
- **Equation**: $\frac{x}{3} = 9$
- **Operation**: Multiply both sides by 3 to isolate $x$.
- **Solution**:

  $\frac{x}{3} \times 3 = 9 \times 3$
  
  $x = 27$

<br>

#### Division
- **Equation**: $5x = 20$
- **Operation**: Divide both sides by 5 to isolate $x$.
- **Solution**:

  $\frac{5x}{5} = \frac{20}{5}$
  
  $x = 4$

#### Power of (Exponents)
- **Equation**: $x^2 = 49$
- **Operation**: Take the square root of both sides to isolate $x$.
- **Solution**:

  $\sqrt{x^2} = \sqrt{49}$
  
  $x = \pm 7$ (Note: The solution includes both positive and negative roots because squaring either +7 or -7 gives 49.)
