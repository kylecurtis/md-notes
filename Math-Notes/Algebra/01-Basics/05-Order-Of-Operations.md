PEMDAS is an acronym that helps remember the order of operations in algebra to ensure consistent results in calculations. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

## Detailed Order of Operations

1. **Parentheses (P)**: Solve all operations inside parentheses first; this also applies to brackets and other grouping symbols like absolute value bars and radicals.
2. **Exponents (E)**: Evaluate powers and roots.
3. **Multiplication and Division (MD)**: Perform all multiplication and division as they appear from left to right.
4. **Addition and Subtraction (AS)**: Perform all addition and subtraction as they appear from left to right.

## Example Calculation

To clarify the order, consider the expression: $3 + 6 \times (5 + 4) \div 3^2 - 1$.

- **Step 1: Parentheses**
  - Calculate inside the parentheses: $5 + 4 = 9$
  - Expression becomes: $3 + 6 \times 9 \div 3^2 - 1$

- **Step 2: Exponents**
  - Evaluate $3^2 = 9$
  - Expression becomes: $3 + 6 \times 9 \div 9 - 1$

- **Step 3: Multiplication and Division**
  - Perform the multiplication and division from left to right:
    - $6 \times 9 = 54$
    - $54 \div 9 = 6$
  - Expression becomes: $3 + 6 - 1$

- **Step 4: Addition and Subtraction**
  - Perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
    - $3 + 6 = 9$
    - $9 - 1 = 8$

- **Result**: The final answer is $8$.
