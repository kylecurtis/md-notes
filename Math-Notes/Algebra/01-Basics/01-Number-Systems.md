In algebra, different types of numbers are classified into systems based on their properties. Understanding these systems is foundational for studying more complex algebraic concepts.

## Natural Numbers

- **Definition**: The set of positive integers starting from 1. 
- **Symbol**: $\mathbb{N}$
- **Example**: $1, 2, 3, 4, \dots$

<br>

## Whole Numbers

- **Definition**: All natural numbers including zero.
- **Symbol**: $\mathbb{W}$
- **Example**: $0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$

<br>

## Integers
- **Definition**: All whole numbers including their negative counterparts.
- **Symbol**: $\mathbb{Z}$
- **Example**: $\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$

<br>

## Rational Numbers
- **Definition**: Numbers that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction of two integers, where the denominator is not zero.
- **Symbol**: $\mathbb{Q}$
- **Example**: $\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{4}{5}, 0.75$

<br>

## Irrational Numbers
- **Definition**: Numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. Their decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating.
- **Symbol**: $\mathbb{I}$
- **Example**: $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$

<br>

## Real Numbers
- **Definition**: The union of both rational and irrational numbers. They correspond to all possible points along the infinite line known as the number line.
- **Symbol**: $\mathbb{R}$
- **Example**: $-1.5, \sqrt{3}, 0.333\dots, 4$

<br>

## Complex Numbers
- **Definition**: Numbers that include a real part and an imaginary part. The imaginary unit, denoted as 'i', is defined as $\sqrt{-1}$.
- **Symbol**: $\mathbb{C}$
- **Example**: $2 + 3i, -5 - 2i$
