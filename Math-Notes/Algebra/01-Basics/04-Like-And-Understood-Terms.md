## Understood 1
- **Definition**: Often in algebra, the coefficient '1' is implied and not explicitly written.
- **Example**: $x$ is actually $1x$.

<br>

## Understood x
- **Definition**: Similarly, the exponent '1' on a variable is usually not written.
- **Example**: $x$ actually means $x^1$.

## Operations on Like Terms
Like terms in algebraic expressions are terms that have exactly the same variable components raised to the same powers.

<br>

#### Adding Like Terms
- **Process**: Sum the coefficients of like terms.
- **Example**: $3x + 2x = (3+2)x = 5x$

<br>

#### Subtracting Like Terms
- **Process**: Subtract the coefficients of like terms.
- **Example**: $5x - 3x = (5-3)x = 2x$

<br>

#### Multiplying Like Terms
- **Process**: Multiply the coefficients and add the exponents of the variables.
- **Example**: $3x^2 \times 2x^3 = (3 \times 2)x^{2+3} = 6x^5$

<br>

#### Dividing Like Terms
- **Process**: Divide the coefficients and subtract the exponents of the variables.
- **Example**: $\frac{4x^5}{2x^3} = \frac{4}{2}x^{5-3} = 2x^2$
