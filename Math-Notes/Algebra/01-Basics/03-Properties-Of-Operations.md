## Commutative Property
- **Applies to**: Addition and Multiplication
- **Definition**: Changing the order of the operands does not change the result.
- **Example**: 
  - Addition: $a + b = b + a$
  - Multiplication: $ab = ba$

<br>

## Associative Property
- **Applies to**: Addition and Multiplication
- **Definition**: Changing the grouping of operands does not change the result.
- **Example**:
  - Addition: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
  - Multiplication: $(ab)c = a(bc)$

<br>

## Distributive Property
- **Applies to**: Multiplication over Addition and Subtraction
- **Definition**: A single term outside a parenthesis can be distributed to each term inside.
- **Example**: $a(b + c) = ab + ac$

<br>

## Identity Property
- **Applies to**: Addition and Multiplication
- **Definition**: The operation of adding zero or multiplying by one leaves an element unchanged.
- **Example**:
  - Addition: $a + 0 = a$
  - Multiplication: $a \times 1 = a$

<br>

## Inverse Property
- **Applies to**: Addition and Multiplication
- **Definition**: For every element, there is another element which combines with it to yield the identity element of the operation.
- **Example**:
  - Addition: $a + (-a) = 0$
  - Multiplication: $a \times \frac{1}{a} = 1$ (for $a \neq 0$)

<br>

## Zero Property of Multiplication
- **Applies to**: Multiplication
- **Definition**: Any number multiplied by zero is zero.
- **Example**: $a \times 0 = 0$

<br>

## Transitive Property
- **Applies to**: Equations and Inequalities
- **Definition**: If one quantity equals a second, and the second equals a third, then the first equals the third.
- **Example**: If $a = b$ and $b = c$, then $a = c$
